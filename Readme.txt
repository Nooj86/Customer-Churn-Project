Customer Churn Analysis

Tools used: SQL, Python, Tableau

Objective: 	
Part 1: Analyse given bank data to determine any possible causes of customer churn.
Part 2: Work with a partner to combine your findings and create a presentation of your findings.

Steps: After an intial exploration done in SQL to get an idea of the data, I uploaded the data into python for cleaning and analysis. The data was found to be quite clean without any problematic discrepencies.

I did 3 types of analysis, inivariate, bivariate and multivariate, to discover any causes for customer churn.

After that, I imported the data into Tableau to create more visualizations.

Finally, working with a partner, we created and recorded a 5 minute presentation.
